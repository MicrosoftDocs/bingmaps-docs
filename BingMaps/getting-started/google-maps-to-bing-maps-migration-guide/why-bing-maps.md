# Why Bing Maps?

[!INCLUDE [bing-maps-enterprise-service-retirement](../../includes/bing-maps-enterprise-service-retirement.md)]

Bing Maps offers numerous advantages over the Google Maps JavaScript API. Here are just a few of them:

- Faster and more fluid map control
- A developer API that "just makes sense"
- More Powerful and Innovative API
- Modular Framework
- Enterprise Level Service
- A Global Cloud platform

## Faster and more fluid map control

When it comes to performance the Bing Maps has Google Maps beat. Bing
Maps can render a lot more data than Google Maps and can do so just as
fast, if not faster. When dealing with small data sets on a standard
browser this might not be that noticeable but if you need to display a
large data set or are using a mobile browser this increased performance
makes a big difference.

## A developer API that "just makes sense"

Developers who have used both Bing Maps and Google Maps, often say that
the Bing Maps API just feels right. It often takes less code to develop
an application and it fits together nicely. It "just makes sense". Since
it takes less code to develop your application, it takes less
development time and means less code to maintain. Thus, providing you
with more time to focus on your core application.

## More Powerful and Innovative API

The Bing Maps team has spent a lot of time innovating to make the Bing
Maps developer platform align with the needs of businesses. The team
spends a lot of time gathering feedback from customers and users to help
define which new features to add to Bing Maps. Some of the more
innovative features in the latest version of Bing Maps include are:

- Vector map labels which hide when overlapped by your data to ensure
    your data takes priority and isn't cluttered.

- A spatial math library that provides easy access to over 50 powerful
    calculations.

- Multiple road map styles designed for business intelligence type
    applications. This includes a dark, grayscale and a high contrast
    map style. These map styles allow the map to act as a canvas in the
    background and allows your data to stand out and be the main focus
    of your application.

- Bing Maps has added a lot of accessibility support to help you meet
    your accessibility goals.

- New data visualizations such as Data binning layers provide new and
    engaging ways to gain insight into your business data.

## Modular Framework

The Bing Maps control uses a modular framework to minimize loading of
features and functionalities that may not be needed when an application
is loaded, such as directions. The base map control consists of several
core features such as support for pushpins, polylines, polygons, and
tile layers. Modules allow users to load only the features and
functionalities they need, when they need them, rather than having to
load all features when the application loads. For a list of
modules in Bing Maps, see [modules](../../v8-web-control/modules/index.md).
For additional information about the modular framework in Bing Maps, see
[Modular Framework](../../v8-web-control/map-control-concepts/modular-framework/index.md).

## Enterprise Level Service

email. Many customers who went from Bing Maps to Google Maps often
citied the superior technical support offering from Bing Maps as a key
reason for switching back. In addition to this, the terms of use for
Bing Maps often align much better with enterprise privacy and security
requirements. See [Bing Maps for Enterprise Developer Support Overview](https://aka.ms/BMESupport) to learn more about the Enterprise support services available to all licensed Bing Maps customers.
