# Getting a Bing Maps Key

To use the [Bing Maps APIs](../../rest-services/index.md), you must have a Bing Maps Key.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  When you use the Bing Maps APIs with a Bing Maps Key, usage transactions are logged. See [Understanding Bing Maps Transactions](understanding-bing-maps-transactions.md) for more information.  
  
## Creating a Bing Maps Key  
  
1.  Go to the Bing Maps Dev Center at [https://www.bingmapsportal.com/](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/).  
  
    -   If you have a Bing Maps account, sign in with the Microsoft account that you used to create the account or create a new one. For new accounts, follow the instructions in [Creating a Bing Maps Account](creating-a-bing-maps-account.md).  
  
2.  Select **My keys** under **My Account**.  
  
3.  Select the option to create a new key.  
  
4.  Provide the following information to create a key:  
  
    -   **Application name**: Required. The name of the application.  
  
    -   **Application URL**: The URL of the application. This is an optional field which is useful in helping you remember the purpose of that key in the future.  
  
    -   **Key type**:  Required.  Select the key type that you want to create. You can find  descriptions of key and application types [here](https://www.microsoft.com/maps/create-a-bing-maps-key.aspx).  
  
    -   **Application type**:  Required. Select the application type that best represents the application that will use this key. You can find descriptions of key and application types [here](https://www.microsoft.com/maps/create-a-bing-maps-key.aspx).  
  
5.  Click the **Create** button. The new key displays in the list of available keys. Use this key to authenticate your Bing Maps application as described in the documentation for the Bing Maps API you are using.
