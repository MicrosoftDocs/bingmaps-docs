# Understanding Bing Maps Transactions

When you use any [Bing Maps API](../../rest-services/index.md) with a Bing Maps Key (you must have a [Bing Maps Account](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/)), transactions are recorded. Transactions track API usage and can be billable or non-billable. For example, using the [Bing Maps V8 Web Control](../../v8-web-control/index.md) to show a map on a web page or geocoding an address using the [Bing Maps REST Services](../../rest-services/index.md) are both billable transactions, while deleting a data source (a spatial database that you create using the [Bing Spatial Data Services](../../spatial-data-services/index.md)) is not.  
  
 You can find descriptions of the transactions for each Bing Maps API in the tables below, and you can view transaction totals over time on the [Bing Maps Account Center](https://www.bingmapsportal.com). For more information, see [Viewing Usage Reports](#viewing-usage-reports). Note that it may take up to 24 hours for new transactions to appear.

## Billable versus non-billable transactions  

Only billable transactions count towards the free-use limits for Basic keys, and Enterprise keys are only charged for billable transactions.  Non-billable transactions do not incur charges and do not count towards free-use limits. To determine if your application will qualify for free use and for info about licensing and transaction limits, [please see the Bing Maps licensing page](https://www.microsoft.com/maps/licensing) and review the [Bing Maps Terms of Use](https://www.microsoft.com/maps/product/terms.html).
  
### Using Session IDs to make billable transactions non-billable

 In the following description, Bing Maps services refer to Bing Maps REST Services and Bing Spatial Data Services<sup>1</sup>. Bing Maps controls refer to Bing Maps V8 Web Control, Bing Maps WPF Control, and Windows 10 UWP Map control.  
  
Bing Maps service requests originating from a Bing Maps control that use a session ID instead of the Bing Maps key are non-billable up to 25 requests per session. The 26th transaction and every transaction thereafter will be billable. For example, if you make a Bing Maps REST Services request to geocode an address from the Bing Maps V8 web control and use the [Map.getCredentials](../../v8-web-control/map-control-api/map-class.md) method to get the session ID for authentication, the resulting transaction is recorded as non-billable even though it is listed as a billable transaction in the table below.  
  
 You must use the Bing Maps Key that you used to load the map control to request a session ID. This session ID is only valid for the map control session. For the Bing Maps V8 web control, a session begins with the load of the map into a user’s browser and ends when the browser is closed or the user moves to a different page. Similarly for the WPF control, a session begins when the map control is loaded by the application and ends when the application is closed. Note that the Windows 10 UWP Map control does not provide access to session keys but instead provides native geocoding and routing functionalities which automatically make use of sessions. For more information about how to get a session ID from the Bing Maps Key, see [Using the REST Services with .NET](../../rest-services/using-the-rest-services-with-net.md) and [Map Class](../../v8-web-control/map-control-api/map-class.md). Note that if you make service requests with a Bing Maps Key instead of a session ID within the session, you will be charged for all billable requests.  


## Bing Maps Transactions by API  
 The following tables define transactions for all the APIs.  
  
### Map Control APIs (Web V8, UWP, WPF, iOS, Android, Unity)  
  
|Category|Bing Maps API|Billable|Category Description|  
|--------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------------------|  
|iOS-Control|iOS Control|Yes|Any time a session is started and uses the Bing Maps iOS control with a valid Bing Maps Key, one (1) transaction is counted. A session begins with the load of the Bing Maps iOS control by the application and ends when the application is closed or the control is disposed. Panning, zooming, changing of the map type (i.e.: road, aerial, etc.) or overlaying data on the map within the session doesn't cause additional transactions to be accrued.<br /><br />Anytime the Map Services API is used without a map, one (1) transaction is counted. All REST service requests that originate from Map Services and use a session ID are not billable when they are made from within a session.|
|Android-Control|Android Control|Yes|Any time a session is started and uses the Bing Maps Android control with a valid Bing Maps Key, one (1) transaction is counted. A session begins with the load of the Bing Maps Android control by the application and ends when the application is closed or the control is disposed. Panning, zooming, changing of the map type (i.e.: road, aerial, etc.) or overlaying data on the map within the session doesn't cause additional transactions to be accrued.<br /><br />Anytime the Map Services API is used without a map, one (1) transaction is counted. All REST service requests that originate from Map Services and use a session ID are not billable when they are made from within a session.|
|Web-V8-Control (formerly AjaxSession-V8)|Web Control|Yes|Any time a session that uses the Bing Maps Version 8.0 web control, is started with a valid Bing Maps Key, one (1) transaction is counted. A session begins with the load of the Bing Maps Web Control into a user’s browser and ends when the browser is closed or the user moves to a different page. Panning, zooming, changing of the map type (i.e.: road, aerial, etc.) or overlaying data on the map within the session doesn't cause additional transactions to be accrued.<br /><br /> Anytime the Autosuggest Module is used without a map and a user selects a location suggestion from the menu one (1) transaction is counted.  When using the AutoSuggest Module, transactions are not logged for user key strokes or based on the number of location results that are returned in the Autosuggest menu.<br /><br /> All REST or Spatial Data<sup>2</sup> service requests that use a [session ID](#using-session-ids-to-make-billable-transactions-non-billable) are **not** billable when they are made from within a session.|  
|Win10-Control (formerly Win10-Native)|Windows 10 UWP Map control|Yes|Any time a session is started and uses the Windows 10 UWP Map control with a valid Bing Maps Key, one (1) transaction is counted. A session begins with the load of the Windows 10 UWP Map control in an application and ends when the application is closed or the control is disposed. Panning, zooming, changing of the map type (i.e.: road, aerial, etc.) or overlaying data on the map within the session doesn't cause additional transactions to be accrued.<br /><br />Anytime the Map Services API is used without a map, one (1) transaction is counted. All REST service requests that originate from Map Services and use a session ID are not billable when they are made from within a session.|  
|WPF-Control (formerly WPFSession)|WPF Control|Yes|Any time a session is started and uses the Bing Maps WPF control with a valid Bing Maps Key, one (1) transaction is counted. A session begins with the load of the Bing Maps WPF control by the application and ends when the application is closed or the control is disposed. Panning, zooming, changing of the map type (i.e.: road, aerial, etc.) or overlaying data on the map within the session doesn't cause additional transactions to be accrued.<br /><br /> All REST or Spatial Data<sup>2</sup> service requests that use a [session ID](#using-session-ids-to-make-billable-transactions-non-billable) are **not** billable when they are made from within a session.|
|Unity-Control (PREVIEW)|Unity Control|Yes|Any time an application session is started and uses a MapRenderer component and a MapSession component with a valid Bing Maps Key, one (1) transaction is counted. An application session begins with each initialization of a MapRenderer by the application and ends when the application is closed or the session expires. When a session expires and the application is still active, a new session is created and one (1) transaction is counted. Panning and zooming a MapRenderer doesn't cause additional transactions to be accrued. Any time the MapSession component's GetRegion API is called without a MapRenderer session already being active, one (1) transaction is counted. Any time a Map Service API is called, i.e.: MapLocationFinder, one (1) transaction is counted.|
  
<sup>2</sup>All Spatial Data Services requests over one (1) million per year are billable even when a session ID is used.
