# Downloading a Data Source

In [Bing Maps Dev Center](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/), go to the **Manage data sources** page under **Data sources** and view the **Published Data Sources** tab. Find the data source, and click **Download** to start the download process. Data source downloads are in XML format and contain all entity data and the data schema. The download file structure is the same as the XML file structure used for uploading entity data to a data source. Therefore, you can download the XML file, make updates, and then upload and publish the file to update the data source with your changes.  
  
 **Transaction Accounting**: Transactions are counted when you use the Bing Maps Dev Center to create and manage data sources. For more information about these transactions, see [Understanding Bing Maps Transactions](../understanding-bing-maps-transactions.md).
