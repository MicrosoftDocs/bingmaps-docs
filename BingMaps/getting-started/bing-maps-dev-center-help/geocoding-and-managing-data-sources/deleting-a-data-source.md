# Deleting a Data Source

> [!CAUTION]
>  Use caution when deleting a data source because this action cannot be reversed.  
  
 To delete a data source, go to the **Manage data sources** page under **Data sources** on the [Bing Maps Dev Center](https://www.bingmapsportal.com), and click the **Published Data Sources** tab. Click **Delete** for the data source that you want to delete.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  For information on data source limits that apply to this feature, see [Geocode and Data Source Limits](../../../spatial-data-services/geocode-and-data-source-limits.md)  
  
 **Transaction Accounting**: Transactions are counted when you use the Bing Maps Dev Center to create and manage data sources. For more information about these transactions, see [Understanding Bing Maps Transactions](../understanding-bing-maps-transactions.md).
