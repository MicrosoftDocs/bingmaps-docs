> **Bing Maps for Enterprise service retirement**
>
> Bing Maps for Enterprise is deprecated and has been retired for all free (Basic) account customers. Enterprise account customers can continue to use Bing Maps for Enterprise services until June 30th, 2028. To avoid service disruptions, all enterprise account customers using Bing Maps for Enterprise REST APIs and SDKs will need to be updated to use [Azure Maps](/azure/azure-maps/) by June 30th, 2028.
>
> Azure Maps is Microsoft's next-generation maps and geospatial services for developers. Azure Maps has many of the same features as Bing Maps for Enterprise, and more. To get started with Azure Maps, create a free [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) and an [Azure Maps account](/azure/azure-maps/how-to-manage-account-keys#create-a-new-account). For more information about azure Maps, see [Azure Maps Documentation](/azure/azure-maps/). For migration guidance, see [Bing Maps Migration Overview](/azure/azure-maps/migrate-bing-maps-overview).
