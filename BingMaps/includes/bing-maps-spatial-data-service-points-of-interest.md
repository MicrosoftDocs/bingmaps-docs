> **Bing Maps Spatial Data Service feature retirement – Points of Interest**
>
> The Bing Maps **Spatial Data Service – Points of Interest** data source will be deprecated and retired on June 30, 2026. To avoid service disruptions, we recommend transitioning to the Azure Maps [Get Search POI](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-poi) API before this date. Azure Maps provides enhanced security, privacy, and compliance features. Resources to aid in your migration:
