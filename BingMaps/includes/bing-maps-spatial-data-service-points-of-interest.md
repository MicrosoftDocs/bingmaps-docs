> **Bing Maps Spatial Data Service feature retirement – Points of Interest**
>
> The Bing Maps **Spatial Data Service – Points of Interest** data source is deprecated and will be retired on June 30, 2026. Azure Maps offers this capability with enhanced security, privacy, and compliance features. For Point of Interest data, we recommend updating your application to use the Azure Maps [Get Search POI](/rest/api/maps/search/get-search-poi) API before that date to avoid service disruptions. We have the following resources available to aid in your migration:
