> **Bing Maps Spatial Data Service Geocode Dataflow API retirement**
>
> Bing Maps Spatial Data Service Geocode Dataflow API is deprecated and will be retired. Free (Basic) account customers can continue to use Bing Maps Spatial Data Service Geocode Dataflow API until June 30th, 2025. Enterprise account customers can continue to use Bing Maps Spatial Data Service Geocode Dataflow API until June 30th, 2028. To avoid service disruptions, all implementations using Bing Maps Spatial Data Service Geocode Dataflow API will need to be updated to use Azure Maps [Get Geocoding Batch](/rest/api/maps/search/get-geocoding-batch) or Azure Maps [Get Reverse Geocoding Batch](/rest/api/maps/search/get-reverse-geocoding-batch) API by the retirement date that applies to your Bing Maps for Enterprise account type. Azure Maps Geocoding Batch API and Azure Maps Reverse Geocode Batch API will be updated to support a larger number of locations per batch soon. For detailed migration guidance, see [Migrate Bing Maps Geocode Dataflow API](/azure/azure-maps/migrate-geocode-dataflow).
