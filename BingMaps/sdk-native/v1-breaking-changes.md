# Breaking API changes in version 1.0


## Overview
One of the main motivations behind the SDK changes for V1 has been to provide a more stable API baseline for our customers. Another major motivation has been to unify our APIs and to get closer parity on all supported platforms.  
In some cases, these challenges have meant making important but necessary breaking changes that clients can depend on going forward. Our own API cleanup efforts have been an important part of the process as well.
Most breaking changes are the result of one of the following:
- Making the overall API leaner.
- Fixing of APIs, notably some events that used to fire outside of the UI thread.
- Overhauling of some features like MapFlyout to make them friendlier and easier to use.
- Renaming of some APIs to better align them with the native platform and/or to conform with established naming conventions.
