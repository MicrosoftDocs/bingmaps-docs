# Bing Maps SDK for Android and iOS

Welcome to the Bing Maps SDK for Android and iOS!

The **Bing Maps SDK for Android** and **Bing Maps SDK for iOS** are libraries for building mapping applications for Android and iOS.
The SDKs feature a native map control and an accompanying map services API set.

The map control is powered by a full vector 3D map engine with [a number of standard mapping capabilities](map-control-concepts/Index.md)
including displaying icons, drawing polylines and polygons, and overlaying texture sources.  The engine brings in the same 3D Native
support you know from the Xaml Map Control in Windows 10, including worldwide 3D elevation data (via our Digital Elevation Model).

The map control shares much in common with the Map Control in Windows 10, so many of the concepts from the Windows 10 control apply as
well.  For more information, please see the [Windows UWP Map Control](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/maps-and-location/index)
documentation.

## Bing Maps Key

You must obtain a Bing Maps Key from [Bing Maps Dev Center](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/) in order to use the Bing Maps SDK for Android and iOS.
Your app must be authenticated to use the map controls and map services. To authenticate your app, you must specify a Bing Maps key through the API.
Visit the [Bing Maps Dev Center Help page](/bingmaps/getting-started/bing-maps-dev-center-help/getting-a-bing-maps-key)
for detailed steps on obtaining one.

## License and Terms of Service

By using the Bing Maps SDK for Android and iOS you accept the [Bing Maps Platform APIs Terms of Use](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkID=66121).
Please review our TOU carefully. It describes in detail what you can and can't do with the SDK.
