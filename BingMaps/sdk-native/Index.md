# Bing Maps SDK for Android and iOS

Welcome to the Bing Maps SDK for Android and iOS!

> Note: The Bing Maps SDK for Android and iOS is currently available as a developer preview. Although we encourage you to try out the SDK in your own prototype code now, we caution the use in production code at this time. The SDK and the native controls will continue to mature and stabilize in future SDK releases.
> If you have feedback about this SDK, please create a new issue in the Bing Maps SDK repo and leave your comments there. If you prefer to submit your feedback privately, you can send it to placeholder@microsoft.com. Your insights and scenarios are critically important to us.


The Bing Maps Android and iOS SDKs use a combination of raster (downloaded-image) and vector (downloaded-map-data) based rendering techniques to provide a fully featured map control. This lets it combine the best of performant
raster based rendering as well as the versatility of vector-based display.

The Bing Maps control features [a number of standard mapping capabilities](map-control-concepts/Index.md) including displaying icons, drawing polylines and polygons, and overlaying texture sources.

The Bing Maps control shares much in common with the Map Control in Windows 10, so many of the concepts 
from the Windows 10 control apply as well.  For more information on the map control, please see the [Windows
control documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/maps-and-location/index).
