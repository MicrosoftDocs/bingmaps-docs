# Polylines and Polygons

Sometimes you will want to draw additional paths between two or more points on the map, or highlight a geographic region. To do this, the
Bing Maps native controls support the concept of **polylines** and **polygons**, respectively.

Use [MapPolyline](../map-control-api/MapPolyline-class.md) to represent a polyline and
[MapPolygon](../map-control-api/MapPolygon-class.md) to represent a multi-point shape on the map.

## Drawing with Polylines and Polygons

See some examples for [How to display a line or shape the map](drawing-with-polylines-and-polygons.md).
