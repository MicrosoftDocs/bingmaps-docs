# Icons

**Icons**, sometimes known as Points of Interest (POI), Pushpins, or Markers, are the primary method in the Bing Maps native controls to add
a graphical image and text at a location within the map.

Use [MapIcon](../map-control-api/MapIcon-class.md) to add a point of interest on the map. You will also want to review how to
[anchor your icons](anchoring-mapIcons.md) to align the location pointed by the icon's image with the desired location on the map.

Icons also support a concept of flyouts. Flyouts are a type of lightweight menu that can show up when a user interacts with an icon. You
can add your own user interface elements on top of a [MapFlyout](display-flyout.md).

## Display icons on the map

See some examples for [How to display pushpins on the map](display-points-of-interest.md).
