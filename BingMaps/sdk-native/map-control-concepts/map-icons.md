# Icons

**Icons**, sometimes known as Point of Interest (POI), Pushpins or Markers, are the primary method in the Bing Maps native controls to add
a graphical image and text at a location within the map.

Use [MapIcon](../map-control-api/MapIcon-class) to add a point of interest on the map. You will also want to review how to [anchor your icons](anchoring-mapIcons.md) to
align the location pointed by the icon's image with the chosen location on the map.

Icons also support a concept of flyouts.  Flyouts are a type of lightweight menu that can show up when a user interacts with an icon. You
can add your own user interface elements on top of a [MapFlyout](display-flyout).
