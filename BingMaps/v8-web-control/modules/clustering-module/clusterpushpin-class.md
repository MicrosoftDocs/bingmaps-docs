# ClusterPushpin Class

This class extends the Pushpin class and has all the same methods and properties plus the following properties.

## Properties

Name                  | Type          | Description
--------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------
`containedPushpins`   | [Pushpin](../../map-control-api/pushpin-class.md)[]     | An array of all the pushpins that are in the cluster.
`gridKey`             | number        | The grid cell key that can be used retrieve the clustered pushpin(s) from the clustering layer. This is useful when creating a clickable list that link items in the list to clusters or pushpins on the map. Your list just needs to store the `gridKey` value.
