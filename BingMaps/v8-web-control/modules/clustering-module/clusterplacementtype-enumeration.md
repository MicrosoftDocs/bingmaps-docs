# ClusterPlacementType Enumeration

The `Microsoft.Maps.ClusterPlacementType` enumeration values can be used to specify how a clustered pushpin should be positioned.

Name                 | Description
-------------------- | ----------------------
`MeanAverage`        | Mean Average placement calculates the average position of a group of coordinates. This method creates a more realistic representation of the data, however requires more processing power and increases the chances of pushpins overlapping.
`FirstLocation`      | This method is the simplest way to represent a cluster. It places the cluster at the first location in the cluster. This method may not accurately represent the data but requires little processing power.
