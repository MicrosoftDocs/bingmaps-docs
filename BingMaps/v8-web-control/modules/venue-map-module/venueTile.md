# Venue Tile JSON class

Encapsulates a tile containing the footprints of venues that overlap that tile.  These tiles are used to select a venue.

While this contains a list of [venue] objects, it is expected that these objects will only have an id, a name, and a single [floor] with the footprint [geometry] in it.

## Properties

| Property        | Type       | Req? | Description |
|-----------------|------------|------|-------------|
| id              | string     |  âœ”   | Web Mercator [quadkey] for the tile.  Typically this is a level 10 tile. |
| venues          | [venue]    |      | Venues containing only footprints that overlap this tile. |

## Example

```json
{
  "id": "0212300302",
  "venues": [{
    "id": "sample-venue",
    "name": { "": "Sample Venue" },
    "floors": [{"entities":[{"type":"Footprint","geometry":[{
      "closed": true,
      "x": [-76.302,49.619,76.591,-49.777],
      "y": [6.794,39.483,-7.388,-40.279]}]}]}],
    "transform": [
      8.999567514436891E-06, 0.0, 0.0,
      0.0, 8.983152841195214E-06, 0.0,
      -122.139084, 47.64425, 1.0]
  }]
}
