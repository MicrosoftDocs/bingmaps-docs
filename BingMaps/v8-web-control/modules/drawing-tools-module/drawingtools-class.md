A callback function can be provided which is invoked when the new shape as be initially created. |

| `drawingChanged`     | [IPrimitive](../../map-control-api/iprimitive-class.md)             | Occurs after the shape has had a change. For example, finished dragging a vertex to a new location.                                    |
| `drawingChanging`    | [IPrimitive](../../map-control-api/iprimitive-class.md)             | Occurs when the shape is being actively manipulated. For example, this event will continuously fire when dragging a vertex of a shape. |
| `drawingEnded`       | [IPrimitive](../../map-control-api/iprimitive-class.md)             | Occurs when the user has finished drawing or editing a shape.                                                                          |
| `drawingModeChanged` | [DrawingModeChangedData](drawingmodechangeddata-object.md) | Occurs when the drawing mode has changed.                                                                                              |
| `drawingStarted`     | [IPrimitive](../../map-control-api/iprimitive-class.md)             | Occurs when the user has started drawing or editing a shape.
