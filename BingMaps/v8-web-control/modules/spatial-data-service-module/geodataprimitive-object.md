# GeoDataPrimitive Object

Represents the primitive object for a boundary returned by the [GeoData API](../../../spatial-data-services/geodata-api.md). 

## Properties

Name                | Type           | Description
------------------- | -------------- | -----------------------------
`PrimitiveID`       | string         | A unique ID associated with this polygon primitive. 
`Shape`             | string         | A comma-delimited sequence starting with the version number of the polygon set followed by a list of compressed polygon "rings" (closed paths represented by sequences of latitude and-longitude points).
`NumPoints`         | string         | The number of vertex points used to define the polygon.
`SourceID`          | string         | An ID identifying the data provider that supplied the data. This ID number will reference one of the sources listed in the array of `CopyrightSources` in the `Copyright` property of the [GeoDataResultSet](geodataresultset-object.md) object.
