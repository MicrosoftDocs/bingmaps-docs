# Filter Class

The Filter class defines the logic behind a filter expression that can be executed against a JSON object or generate a filter string that can be used with the Bing Spatial Data Services.

## Constructor

> Filter(propertyName: string, operator: string | [FilterCompareOperator](filtercompareoperator-enumeration.md), value: any)

## Methods

Name                   | Return Type         | Description
---------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------
`execute(object: any)`    | boolean             | Executes the filter logic against a JSON object and returns a boolean indicating if the object meets the requirement of the Filter. 
`toString()`             | string              | Converts the filter logic into a string format that is compatible with the Bing Spatial Data Services. 

> [!TIP]
> If you have an array of objects and want to filter out those that match your filters, simply loop through your array and execute the filter against each object.
