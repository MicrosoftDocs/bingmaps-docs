# Contour Module

**Namespace**: Microsoft.Maps

**Module Name**: Microsoft.Maps.Contour

Contour Lines, also known as isolines, are lines that connect points that share a characteristic of equal value. These are often used for visualizing data such as elevations, temperatures, and earthquake intensities on a flat 2D map. This module makes it easy to take contour line data and visualize them on Bing Maps as non-overlapping colored areas.
