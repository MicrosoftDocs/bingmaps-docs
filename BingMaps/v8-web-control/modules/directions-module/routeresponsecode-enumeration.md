Contains response codes for a route calculation request.

| Response Code | Name                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 2             | **cannotFindNearbyRoad**       | A nearby road cannot be found for one or more of the route waypoints.                                                                                                           |
| 3             | **tooFar**                     | The distance between two route waypoints, or the total length of the route exceeds the limit of the route mode. Modify the waypoint locations so that they are closer together. |
| 4             | **noSolution**                 | A route cannot be calculated for the specified waypoints. For example, this code is returned when a route between “Seattle, WA” and “Honolulu, HI” is requested.                |
| 5             | **dataSourceNotFound**         | There is no route data for the specified waypoints.                                                                                                                             |

| 8             | **transitStopsTooClose**       | The transit stops are so close that walking is *always* a better option.                                                                                                        |
| 9             | **walkingBestAlternative**     | The transit stops are so close that walking is a better option.                                                                                                                 |

| 12            | **waypointDisambiguation**     | One or more waypoints need to be disambiguated. This error does not occur if the `autoDisplayDisambiguation` directions render option is set to **true**.                     |

| 15            | **atleastTwoWaypointRequired** | At least two waypoints are required to calculate a route.                                                                                                                       |
