# Map Keyboard Shortcuts
The map has a number of keyboard shortcuts built in that make it easier to use the map. These work when the map has focus.

| Zoom into area                                         | Shift + mouse drag on map to draw area |

 > \* These key shortcuts usually share the same key on a keyboard. These were added to improve the user experience, such that it doesn’t matter if the user uses the shift key or not for these shortcuts.
