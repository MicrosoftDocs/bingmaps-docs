# TileLayerOptions Object

The following is a list of option properties that can be used with a TileLayer.

Name                | Type          | Description
------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------
`downloadTimeout`   | number        | The number of milliseconds allowed for the tile layer image download. If the timeout occurs before the image is fully downloaded, the map control considers the download a failure. The default value is 10000. 
`enableCors` | boolean | Allow retrieving data from CORS supported server.
`mercator`          | [TileSource](tilesource-class.md)    | The tile source for the tile layer. Can only be set when TileLayer is initially created.
`opacity`           | number        | The opacity of the tile layer, defined by a number between 0 (not visible) and 1.
`useCredentialsForCORS` | boolean | Specifies that CORS should be made with the "use-credentials" flag instead of "anonymous".
`visible`           | boolean       | A boolean indicating whether to show or hide the tile layer. The default value is true. A value of false indicates that the tile layer is hidden, although it is still an entity on the map.
`zIndex`            | number        | The z-index of the tile layer. See also: [zIndexing in Bing Maps V8](../articles/zindexing-in-bing-maps-v8.md)
