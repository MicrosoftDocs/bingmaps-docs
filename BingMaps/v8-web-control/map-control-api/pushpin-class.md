# Pushpin Class

Pushpins, sometimes also referred to as markers or MapIcons on other mapping platforms, are one of the primary ways of marking a location on a map. The Pushpin class derives from the `IPrimitive` interface.

**Note:** When an array of pushpins are added to the map or a layer, the first pushpin is rendered last. The idea being that if the array contained search results, the first/most relevant result would be rendered on top rather than being covered by other nearby pushpins. This is a fundamental change made to improve the user experience from how previous versions of Bing Maps rendered pushpins.

## Constructor

> Pushpin(location: [Location](location-class.md), options?: [PushpinOptions](pushpinoptions-object.md))

## Methods

The Pushpin class has the following methods.

| Name                            | Return Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
