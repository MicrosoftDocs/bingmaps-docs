# Map Control Concepts for V8 Web Control

The Bing Maps V8 Web Control is designed to be easy adopt and use in your web applications, and familiar to anyone who has worked with Maps or Geospatial data.   Below, you'll find the major set of Map concepts and examples that will help you. 

| Area                               | Description       |
|------------------------------------|-------------------|
| [Map](map/index.md)                      | Load a rich and interactive map in which data can be visualized. |
| [Pushpins](pushpins/index.md)            | Represent point based data using graphical images and text on the map. |
| [Map Shapes: Polylines and Polygons](map-shapes-polylines-and-polygons/index.md) | Represent geographic areas on the map using lines and polygons. |
| [Infoboxes](infoboxes/index.md)          | Add a pop-up user interface to your map in response to user actions. |
| [Layers](layers/index.md)                | Organize and visualize data in engaging ways. |
| [Colors](colors.md) | Find out more about how to work with Colors across various mapping components. |
| [Custom Overlays](custom-overlays/index.md) | Custom Overlays allow you to create and insert your own custom layers into the map. |
| [Event Examples](event-examples/index.md) | Handle interactions with the map control by leveraging Event-based callbacks. |
| [Modular Framework](modular-framework/index.md) | The modular framework lets you build and host reusable pieces of functionality on the map.  In addition, the Bing Maps V8 Web Control features very powerful out-of-the-box modules for adding new visualizations, user interfaces, and for working with  data on the map. |
| [Autosuggest Module Examples](autosuggest-module-examples/index.md) | Provides location based suggestions as you type. |
| [Clustering Module Examples](clustering-module-examples/index.md) | This module allows you to easily add in client side clustering to your application. Client Side Clustering is a method where pushpins that are close together are grouped and represented as a single pushpin, often using a different icon to indicate the cluster. This is a great way to improve both the user experience and performance of the map.|
| [Contour Module Examples](contour-module-examples/index.md) | Contour Lines, also known as isolines, are lines that connect points that share a characteristic of equal value.  |
|[ Data Binning Module Examples](data-binning-module-examples/index.md) | Data binning, is the process of grouping point data into a symmetric gird of geometric shapes. |
| [Directions Module Examples](directions-module-examples/index.md) | Allows you to calculate a route and display it on the map. The route is draggable by default for easy customization. The instructions will also be nicely formatted.|
| [Drawing Tools Module Examples](drawing-tools-module-examples/index.md) | Provides a set of tools for drawing and editing shapes on top of the map. |
| [GeoJSON Module Examples](geojson-module-examples/index.md) | This module makes it easy to import or export data in GeoJSON format. |
| [GeoXml Module Examples](geoxml-module-examples/index.md)| The GeoXml module makes it easy to read and write common geospatial XML file formats such as [KML (Keyhole Markup Language),](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language) KMZ (compressed KML), [GeoRSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoRSS), [GML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_Markup_Language) (Geography Markup Language, exposed via GeoRSS), and [GPX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_Exchange_Format) (GPS Exchange Format). |
| [Heat Map Layer Module Examples](heat-map-module-examples/index.md) | The module allows you to render an array of Location objects as a density based heat map. |
| [Search Module Examples](search-module-examples/index.md) | Provides an easy method for geocoding address and searching for points of interest from JavaScript. |
| [Spatial Data Services Module Examples](spatial-data-services-module-examples/index.md) | This module wraps the Query and GeoData REST APIâ€™s in the Bing Spatial Dara Services and expose them as an easy to use JavaScript library.  |
| [Spatial Math Module Examples](spatial-math-module-examples/index.md) | The module provides a bunch of useful spatial math functions. |
| [Traffic Module Examples](traffic-module-examples.md) | Adds a traffic incident and flow data to the map. |
| [Well Known Text Module Examples](well-known-text-examples/index.md) | This module makes it easy to import or export data in Well Known Text format. |
| [Point Compression Example](point-compression-example.md) | A tool for compressing arrays of location data as an encoded string.  
| [Test Data Generator Example](test-data-generator-example.md) | A tool for generating random test data; pushpins, polylines, polygons, colors, and locations.  |
| [User Location](user-location/index.md) | Display a users' location on the map using browser location finding functionality. |   
| [REST Services Examples](rest-services-examples/index.md) | Examples that show how to use the Bing Maps REST services from your application.
