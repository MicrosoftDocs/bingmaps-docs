# Well Known Text Examples

Well Known Text (WKT) is an Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard that is used to represent spatial data in a textual format. Most OGC-compliant systems support Well Known Text. Spatial functionality in SQL Server 2008, 2012, and SQL Azure can easily convert between a spatial object in the database and WKT. A WKT can only store the information for a single spatial object and this spatial data format is usually used as part of a larger file format or web service response. The [Well Known Text Module](../../modules/well-known-text-module.md) in Bing Maps make it east to read and write data in this format with the map.
