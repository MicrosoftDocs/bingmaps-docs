# Bing Maps Traffic Coverage

Bing Maps APIs provide traffic coverage for the following countries. Traffic incident text is provided in the primary language of the country where the incident occurs.  
  
 ## Traffic Flow
 
 Traffic flow refers to lines of color representing different levels of traffic congestion that display on a Bing map.

 ## Traffic Incidents
 
 Traffic incidents are reports of traffic issues, such as the report of an accident. Traffic incidents are provided by APIs such as the [Bing Maps Traffic API](../rest-services/traffic/index.md) and
