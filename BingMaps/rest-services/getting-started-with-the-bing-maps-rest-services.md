# Getting Started with the Bing Maps REST Services

The Bingâ„¢ Maps REST Services Application Programming Interface (API) is a Representational State Transfer (REST) API that you can use to do common tasks, such as finding an address, retrieving a map with a pushpin and a label, or getting driving directions. You perform these tasks by constructing a URL.
  
 **To use the Bing Maps REST Services, you must have a [Bing Maps Key](../getting-started/bing-maps-dev-center-help/getting-a-bing-maps-key.md).**
