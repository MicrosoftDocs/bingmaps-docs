# Isochrone Data

The response returned by the Isochrone API contains either an `IsochoneResponse` resource or an `RouteProxyAsyncStatus` resource. The `IsochroneResponse` contains the generated polygon isochrone data while the `RouteProxyAsyncStatus` contains status information about an asynchronous request that was made for an isochrone. The following tables provide the descriptions of the `IsochroneResponse` resource fields.

For more information about the common response syntax for the Bing Maps REST Services, see [Common Response Description](../common-response-description.md).

## IsochroneResponse Resource

The IsochroneResponse resource contains the polygons that represent the requested isochrone.

| JSON     | XML      | Type        | Description                                     |
|----------|----------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `origin`   | `Origin`   | `Cooridnate`  | The origin point used to calculate the isochrone area. |
| `polygons` | `Polygons` | `Polygon`\[\] | The polygons that represent the isochrone area. |

## Polygon Class

This class represents a polygon object.

| JSON        | XML         | Type               | Description     |
|-------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| `coordinates` | `Coordinates` | `double`\[\]\[\]\[\] | The coordinate rings that make up the polygon. Where double\[\] represents a single coordinate \[latitude, longitude\], and double\[\]\[\] represents a single ring within a polygon. |
