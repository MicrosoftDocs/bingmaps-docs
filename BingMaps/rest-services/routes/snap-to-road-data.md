# Snap to Road Data

The response returned by the Snap to Road API contains either an `SnapToRoadResponse` resource or an `RouteProxyAsyncStatus` resource. The `SnapToRoadResponse` contains the snapped point data while the `RouteProxyAsyncStatus` contains status information about an asynchronous request that was made for an isochrone. The following tables provide the descriptions of the `SnapToRoadResponse` resource fields.

[!INCLUDE [get-common-response-note](../../includes/get-common-response-note.md)]

## SnapToRoadResponse Resource

Represents a list of snapped or interpolated points returned by the Snap to Road API.

| JSON          | XML           | Type             | Description                                               |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `snappedPoints` | `SnappedPoints` | `SnappedPoint`\[\] | The array of points that have been snapped as well as any points added through interpolation. |

## SnappedPoint Class

Represents a snapped or interpolated point.

| JSON            | XML             | Type       | Description                    |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------|--------------------------------|
|`coordinate`      | `Coordinate`      | `Coordinate` | The coordinate in which a point was snapped to or an interpolated point.   |
| `index`           | `Index`           | `integer`    | The index in the original list of points passed into the query that this snapped point corresponds to. Can be a value between -1 and the number of points – 1. The index will be set to -1 when the point is an interpolated point and not one of the snapped input points. |
| `name`            | `Name`            | `string`     | The name of the street this snapped point lies on, if available. |
| `speedLimit`      | `SpeedLimit`     | `double?`    | The posted speed limit. There are some special values which may be returned:<br/><br/> • Null – Speed limit not requested.<br/> • 0 – Speed limit unavailable. |
| `truckSpeedLimit` | `TruckSpeedLimit` | `double?`    | The posted truck speed limit. There are some special values which may be returned:<br/> <br/> • Null – Truck speed limit not requested.<br/> • 0 – Truck speed limit unavailable, consider using standard speed limit.<br/> • -1 - The road does not allow trucks.  |
