# Distance Matrix Data

The response returned when making an asynchronous request to the Distance Matrix API contains a `DistanceMatrixAsyncStatus` resource which provides information on the status of the request.

The response returned when making a synchronous request to the Distance Matrix API contains a `DistanceMatrix` resource. The information provided in the `DistanceMatrix` resource includes an array of results which correspond to each origin and destination pair in the request. If the request was made asynchronously, the response would provide a request id which can be used to query the status of the asynchronous request.

The following tables provide the descriptions of the `DistanceMatrix` and `DistanceMatrixAsyncStatus` resource fields.

[!INCLUDE [get-common-response-note](../../includes/get-common-response-note.md)]

## DistanceMatrixAsyncStatus Resource

A `DistanceMatrixAsyncStatus` resource is returned as a response when making a `DistanceMatrixAsync` request. This resource provides the status of an asynchronous distance matrix request which includes an estimated amount of time left to process the request, the unique `requestId` to use when checking the status, as well as information on if the request was had any errors or not.

| JSON              | XML               | Type    | Description   |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------|---------------|
| `callbackInSeconds` | `CallbackInSeconds` | `integer` | An estimated number of seconds remaining to complete the request. Wait this long before checking the status again. |
| `callbackUrl`    | `CallbackUrl`       | `string`  | The callback URL to use to check the status of the request. |
| `isAccepted`   | `IsAccepted`   | `boolean` | Specifies if the request is accepted. A request will not be accepted if it is not valid, or is not within the coordinate pair limits. |
| `isCompleted`   | `IsCompleted` | `boolean` | Specifies is the request has completed. |
| `requestId`  | `RequestId` | `string`  | A unique identifier for an asynchronous request. This can be used to retrieve the results of an asynchronous request when it has completed. |
| `resultUrl` | `ResultUrl` | `string`  | When completed, this field will be populated with a URL which can be used to download the results. The downloaded results will be a `DistanceMatrix` resource in JSON format.  |

## DistanceMatrix Resource

The following tables describe the fields in the `DistanceMatrix` resource in a hierarchical manner.

A distance matrix has the following basic structure:

* DistanceMatrix \[one\]
    * DistanceMatrixCell \[For each origin-destination pair and time interval\]

### Top-level Distance Matrix Resource Fields

The following fields are the top-level fields in the `DistanceMatrix` resource. Additional tables describe the fields in each cell of array of results.

| JSON         | XML          | Type                   | Description                                                                                              |
|--------------|--------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `destinations` | `Destinations` | `Coordinate`\[\]         | The array of destinations that were used to calculate the distance matrix.                               |
| `origins`      | `Origins`      | `Coordinate`\[\]         | The array of destinations that were used to calculate the distance matrix.                               |
| `result`       | `Result`       | `DistanceMatrixCell`\[\] | Array of distance matrix cell results containing information for each coordinate pair and time interval. |

### Distance Matrix Cell Fields

These fields are specific to the array of `DistanceMatrixCells` in the `DistanceMatrix` resource.

| JSON             | XML              | Type    | Description   |
|------------------|------------------|---------|---------------|
| `departureTime`    | `DepartureTime`    | `string`  | The departure time in which this cell was calculated for. Only returned when a `startTime` is specified. When an `endTime` is specified in the request several cells will be returned for the same origin and destination pairs, each having a different departure time for each time interval in the generated histogram request. This string is in [ISO 8601 date format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).<br/><br/>**Example**: 2017-09-22T19:27:03.0000000+00:00 |
| `destinationIndex` | `DestinationIndex` | `int`     | The index of the destination in the provided destinations array used to calculate this cell. |
| `hasError`         | `HasError`         | `boolean` | A boolean indicating if an error occurred when calculating this cell. |
| `originIndex`      | `OriginIndex`      | `int`     | The index of the origin in the provided origins array used to calculate this cell. |
| `travelDistance`   | `TravelDistance`   | `double`  | The physical distance covered to complete a route between the origin and destination. Currently all distances returned are in kilometers. When travel mode is set to transit or a path between the origin and destination can't be calculated, this value is set to -1. |
| `travelDuration`   | `TravelDuration`   | `double`  | The time that it takes, in the specified time units, to travel a corresponding `TravelDistance`. If a path a path between the origin and destination can't be calculated, this value will be a negative number. |
| `totalWalkDuration` | `TotalWalkDuration` | `double` | The portion of the total route duration which requires walking. This may occur when the travel mode is set to transit. |

## Coordinate Field

These fields are used to represent a location coordinate.

| JSON      | XML       | Type   | Description                                  |
|-----------|-----------|--------|----------------------------------------------|
| `latitude`  | `Latitude`  | `double` | The latitude information of the coordinate.  |
| `longitude` | `Longitude` | `double` | The longitude information of the coordinate. |
