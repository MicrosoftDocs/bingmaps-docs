# Bing Maps Routes API

Use the Routes API to create a route that includes two or more locations and to create routes from major roads. You can create driving or walking routes. Driving routes can include traffic information. You can also overlay routes on map imagery.  
  
 For information about how to overlay routes on a static map using the Bing Maps REST Services Imagery API, see [Get a Static Map](../imagery/get-a-static-map.md).

|[Calculate a Route](calculate-a-route.md)|Get a walking, driving or transit route by specifying a series of waypoints.|  
|[Calculate a Truck Route](calculate-a-truck-route.md)|Calculate routes which take into consideration truck attributes. Such as size, weight, and type of cargo.|  
|[Calculate Routes from Major Roads](calculate-routes-from-major-roads.md)|Get driving routes to a location from major roads in four directions (West, North, East and South)|
