# Route Data

The response returned by Routes URL contains a Route resource. The information provided in the Route resource includes the route distance, the travel time, and the itinerary details for each route leg. A route leg is a section of the route defined by two waypoints, and it provides a set of route steps to follow. A route step includes instructions, as well as further details (warnings and hints) about the route, when available. When a route path is requested by setting the *routeAttributes* parameter to *routePath* in the request, the Route resource also provides a set of Point (latitude and longitude) values for each route leg. The following tables provide the descriptions of the Route resource fields, followed by XML and JSON examples.  
  
[!INCLUDE [get-common-response-note](../../includes/get-common-response-note.md)]
  
## Route Resource

The following tables describe the fields in the Route resource in a hierarchical manner.  
  
> [!WARNING]
>  Any fields that are returned in the response and that are not in these tables are not supported.  
  
 A route has the following basic structure:  
  
-   Route [one or more]  
  
    -   RouteLeg [For each set of waypoints]  
  
        -   RouteSubLeg [For a set of route leg waypoints and any via-waypoints]  
  
        -   ItineraryItem [one or more route leg steps]  
  
            -   Detail [one or more set of detailed instructions for a route step]  
  
    -   RoutePath [when requested]  
  
### Top-level Route Resource Fields

|`__type`||`string`|This field tells you the version of REST API being used. This data field should not have any effect on your application's handling of the response.|  
  
### Route Leg Fields  

These fields are specific to the RouteLeg collection in the Route resource.  
  
|JSON|XML|Type|Description|  
|----------|---------|----------|-----------------|

In most cases, the ActualStart is the same as the requested waypoint. However, if a waypoint is not close to a road, the Routes API chooses a location on the nearest road as the starting point of the route. This ActualStart element contains the latitude and longitude of this new location.|  
|`actualEnd`|`ActualEnd`|Point. For more information about the Point type, see [Location and Area Types](../common-parameters-and-types/location-and-area-types.md).|The Point (latitude and longitude) that was used as the actual ending location for the route leg. In most cases, the ActualEnd is the same as the requested waypoint.

This ActualEnd element contains the latitude and longitude of this new location.|  
|`startLocation`|`StartLocation`|Complex object|Information about the location of the starting waypoint for a route. A StartLocation is provided only when the waypoint is specified as a landmark or an address. For more information about the fields contained in a Location collection, see the Location Fields table below.|

|`startTime`||String|Used for transit route responses. Shows the starting time for the starting point of the route. This tells you when to be at the starting waypoint depending on what you select as the dateTime and the timeType. **Important:**  The transit API expects the user to provide start time, end time parameters in the local timezone of the region they are querying. The underlying API also uses data in the local timezone of that region. The API does not need to know and does not return the exact timezone of the region. Therefore any datetime values in transit API response are also in the local timezone of the region where the transit agency operates.|  
|`endTime`||String|Used for transit route responses. Shows the time of arrival when specific route is taken. This tells you when to be at the ending waypoint depending on what you select as the dateTime and the timeType parameters **Important:**  The transit API expects the user to provide start time, end time parameters in the local timezone of the region they are querying. The underlying API also uses data in the local timezone of that region. The API does not need to know and does not return the exact timezone of the region. Therefore any datetime values in transit API response are also in the local timezone of the region where the transit agency operates.|  
|`routeSubLegs`|`RouteSubLegs`|collection|Information about a segments of the route leg defined by the route leg waypoints and any intermediate via-waypoints. For example, if the route leg has two via-waypoints in addition to start and end waypoints, there would be three (3) route sub-legs. For information about the fields that make up a sub-leg, see the Route Sub-Leg fields table below.|  
|`itineraryItem`|`ItineraryItem`|collection|Information that defines a step in the route. For information about the fields that make up the ItineraryItem collection, see the Itinerary Item Fields table below.|

The first integer in the string (1318005467000) represents the number of seconds since 12:00:00 midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC. The remainder of the string (-0700) represents an offset in hours that you must apply to get the local time. For example, the integer 1318005467000 represents the time '10/7/2011 4:37:47 PM'.

|`mode`||`string`|Describes the mode of transportation used between a pair of indexes. This can differ depending whether the route requires walking, driving, or transit. **Tip:**  Not all regions or cultures support all values of this field. If you use a value that is not supported, the end user may receive an error message. If you are unsure which markets the URL will be used in, it is recommended to not use this parameter.  Without the “mode” parameter, Bing Maps will silently fall to a default value of **Transit**.|  
|`name`|`Name`|string|A street, highway or intersection where the maneuver occurs. If the maneuver is complex, there may be more than one name field in the details collection. The name field may also have no value.

### Route Path Fields  
 A RoutePath is included in the response when one of following parameters is set in the request. Of the route path options, the routeAttributes method is the newest and the recommended way to request a route path. The routeAttributes parameter can also take other values (see [Calculate a Route](calculate-a-route.md)),and when it is set, the routePathOutput parameter is ignored. Therefore, of these two options, it is best to use the routeAttributes parameter.  
  
1.  routeAttributes=routePath [recommended]  
  
2.  routePathOutput=Points  
  
 When tolerances are specified in the request, subsets of these points called route path generalizations are provided that can be used to represent the route on maps that do not need the accuracy of the complete set of points.  
  
|JSON|XML|Type|Description|  
|----------|---------|----------|-----------------|  
|`line`|`Line`|A Complex object|A collection of point (latitude and longitude) elements. When the points in the line are connected, they represent the path of the route. **Note:**  Coordinates is an array of array of numbers rather than an array|  
|`point`|`Point`|Point. For more information about the point type, see [Location and Area Types](../common-parameters-and-types/location-and-area-types.md).|The coordinates of a point on the Earth. A point contains Latitude and Longitude elements.|  
|generalizations|RoutePathGeneralization|collection|A generalization is a collection of index elements and a latlong tolerance element specifying a subset of route points that satisfy the tolerance.|  
|`pathIndices`|`Index`|`integer`|Specifies a subset of points from the complete set of route path points (line collection) to include in the RoutePathGeneralization. The list of point values in the route path line collection are given indices starting with 0. For example, an index value of 0 indicates that the first point in the Line collection is included in this RoutePathGeneralization.|  
|`latLongTolerance`|`LatLongTolerance`|`integer`|The tolerance specified in the route request that is associated with the RoutePathGeneralization.|
