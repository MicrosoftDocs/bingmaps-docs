# Traffic API

Use the Traffic API to get information about traffic incidents and issues, such as construction sites and traffic congestion. For traffic incident coverage by country/region, see [Bing Maps Geographic Coverage](../../coverage/geographic-coverage.md). For an overview of how traffic incident information is returned by the Routes API and the Traffic API, see [Getting Traffic Incident Data](../getting-traffic-incident-data.md).
