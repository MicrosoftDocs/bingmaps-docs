# Traffic Incident Data

The response returned by a Traffic URL contains one or more TrafficIncident resources. Each TrafficIncident resource contains information about a traffic issues that met the criteria specified in the URL request, such as map area, incident type and severity. This following table provides descriptions of the TrafficIncident resource fields and is followed by JSON and XML examples.  
  
## Traffic Incident Resource 
 
 The following table describes the fields in the traffic incident resource. One or more traffic incident resources are returned when you request traffic data. These resources are inside a common response wrapper for the Bing Maps REST Services.  For more information about the common response wrapper, see [Common Response Description](../common-response-description.md).  
  
 Fields marked **Required** are always provided for each traffic incident. Other fields are optional and not always included.

### About time values  

Time values in the TrafficIncident resource data use UTC time. The format for XML and JSON responses are different.  
  
For JSON responses, the time is specified as UTC time in milliseconds using the epoch (start time) of January 1, 1970, 00:00:00.  The JSON field uses the following format.  
  
`Date(milliseconds)`  
  
 JSON Example: Date(1295704800000)  
  
 For XML responses, the time is specified as UTC time and uses the following format. A time zone offset is not specified.  
  
`YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sZ`
  
 XML Example: 2011-06-29T23:44:56.593Z  
  
 For more information about UTC time see [W3C Date and Time Formats](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime).
