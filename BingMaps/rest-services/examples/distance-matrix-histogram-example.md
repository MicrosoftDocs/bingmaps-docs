# Distance Matrix Histogram Example

> [!NOTE]
> **Bing Maps Distance Matrix Histogram functionality is retired**
>
> Bing Maps Distance Matrix Histogram functionality is no longer available. All implementations using Bing Maps Calculate a Distance Matrix API will need to be updated to use Azure Maps [Route Matrix](/rest/api/maps/route/get-route-matrix) API and, while it is not included, a histogram can be created from those results.
>
> Azure Maps is Microsoft's next-generation maps and geospatial services for developers. Azure Maps has many of the same features as Bing Maps for Enterprise, and more. To get started with Azure Maps, create aâ€¯free [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) and an [Azure Maps account](/azure/azure-maps/how-to-manage-account-keys#create-a-new-account). For more information about azure Maps, see [Azure Maps Documentation](/azure/azure-maps/). For migration guidance, see [Bing Maps Migration Overview](/azure/azure-maps/migrate-bing-maps-overview).
