# Map Style Sheet Entry Properties

The properties that are grouped and listed below can be set on [entries](map-style-sheet-entries.md) in a [map style sheet](map-style-sheets.md) to customize the appearance of a map in various [Microsoft map controls](map-style-sheet-support.md).

> [!TIP]
> Map style sheets can be created interactively using the [Map Style Sheet Editor application](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBHTCJT72FT).

In this simple JSON style sheet, the "water" entry is a MapElement, so it can set the "fillColor" property.

```json
{"version":"1.*", "elements":{"water":{"fillColor":"#FF0000"}}}
```

All color values are specified as a hex **\#RRGGBB** or **\#AARRGGBB** string.

> [!TIP]
> Ensure that all colors have 6 or 8 characters. If there is any other number of characters, the style will be considered invalid.
