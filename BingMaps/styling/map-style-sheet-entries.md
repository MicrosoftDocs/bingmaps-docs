# Map Style Sheet Entries

The entries listed below can be used in a [map style sheet](map-style-sheets.md) to customize the appearance of a map in various [Microsoft map controls](map-style-sheet-support.md). They can also be used to define how overlaid geometry on a map should be represented.

> [!TIP]
> Map style sheets can be created interactively using the [Map Style Sheet Editor application](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBHTCJT72FT).
