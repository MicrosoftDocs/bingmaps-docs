# Bing Spatial Data Services
The Bingâ„¢ Spatial Data Services Application Programming Interface (API) provides a Representational State Transfer (REST) interface that can geocode, store and query spatial data. This simple REST interface accomplishes tasks by setting parameters in a URL and then submitting the URL as an HTTP request. The HTTP response returns the results of the request.  
  
 With the Bing Spatial Data Services, you can:  
  
-   Geocode and reverse-geocode large numbers of locations with the [Geocode Dataflow API](geocode-dataflow-api/index.md).  
  
-   Store and query entities with a location, such as set of retail stores or restaurants using our [Data Source Management API](data-source-management-api/index.md) and [Query API](query-api/index.md).  
  
 **Bing Maps Account Center (alternative)**:  You can also manage data sources and geocode using the [Bing Maps Account Center](https://www.bingmapsportal.com). For more information, see [Creating and Managing Data Sources](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh698204.aspx).
