# Load Data Source Dataflow
Load Data Source Dataflow API to create a data source that contains entity data for a user-specified entity type. For example, a data source could contain location and hours of operation information for a set of restaurants. With the Load Data Source Dataflow API you can:  
  
-   Create a data source.  
  
-   Update, add and delete data source entities.  
  
-   Overwrite an existing data source.  
  
-   Make your data source public.  
  
 You can also use the [Bing Maps Account Center](https://www.bingmapsportal.com) to create or update a data source. The Bing Maps Account Center also offers the option to geocode address data on upload. For more information, see [Creating and Managing Data Sources](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh698204.aspx).  
  
 **Before using this API, review the [Geocode and Data Source Limits](../../geocode-and-data-source-limits.md).**  
  
 The Load Data Source Dataflow API creates and updates data sources by creating load data source jobs. The [Create a Load Data Source Job](../../data-source-management-api/load-data-source-dataflow/create-a-load-data-source-job-and-input-entity-data.md) URL is used to create the load data source job and requires a data schema and a set of entity data. The data schema and entity data can be provided in XML format or as values separated by commas, tabs or pipe (&#124;) values. KML, KMZ and shapefile formats are also supported. Shapefile data must be uploaded as a zipped set of .shp, .shx, and .dbf files. For more information about the data schema and input data, see [Data Schema and Sample Input](../../data-source-management-api/load-data-source-dataflow/load-data-source-data-schema-and-sample-input.md).  
  
 After you have created a job, you can use the [Get Load Data Source Status](../../data-source-management-api/load-data-source-dataflow/get-load-data-source-status.md) URL to get job status. A job can have one of three statuses: “Pending”, “Completed” or “Aborted”. A job has a “Pending” status when it is created and keeps that status until the job is “Completed” or Aborted”. When a job completes, the response returns a unique base URL that you can use to query the data source with the [Query API](../../query-api/index.md).  
  
 You can delete a data source by using the [Delete a Data Source](../../data-source-management-api/delete-data-source.md) API.
