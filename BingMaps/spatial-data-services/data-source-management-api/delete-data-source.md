# Delete a Data Source
Use the following URL to delete a data source. To delete a data source, a delete data source job is created.  
  
 You can also use the [Bing Maps Account Center](https://www.bingmapsportal.com) to delete a data source. For more information, see [Creating and Managing Data Sources](../../getting-started/bing-maps-dev-center-help/geocoding-and-managing-data-sources/index.md).  
  
 A job is created when you delete a data source.  Before using this API, review the job limits in [Geocode and Data Source Limits](../geocode-and-data-source-limits.md).  
  
 To get a list of all the data source and geocode jobs submitted in the last 15 days, see [Get Job List](../get-job-list.md).  
  
## Supported HTTP Methods  
 DELETE  
  
### URL Template  
 **Delete a data source.**  
  
 The key parameter in this URL must be set to the data source master key.  
  
 You can get the data source base component (http://spatial.virtualearth.net/REST/v1/data/*accessId*/*dataSourceName*), by using the [Get Data Source Information](../data-source-management-api/get-data-source-information.md) API and requesting information about all the data sources associated with the Bing Maps Account that manages the data source.  
  
 The URL uses the **HTTP DELETE** method so you cannot delete a datasource by typing the URL directly in the address bar of a browser. See the **Example** section for more information.  
  
```url
http://spatial.virtualearth.net/REST/v1/data/accessId/dataSourceName?key=masterKey  
```  
  
 After you initiate a job to delete a data source, you must wait until the delete job is completed before creating a new data source with the same name.

 The following request deletes a data source. The key parameter must be set to the data source master key. You cannot submit this URL directly from the Address bar in a browser because the URL uses the HTTP DELETE method. You may want to use a tool such as [Fiddler](https://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/) or [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) to submit this URL request.  
  
```url
DELETE http://spatial.virtualearth.net/REST/v1/data/12ccc26d9e9412345f94922212345/ADataSourceName?key=masterKey HTTP/1.1  
```

     This error code can occur in any of the following conditions:
