# Download a Data Source Dataflow
Use the Data Source Download Dataflow API to download entity data from a published data source.  
  
 You can also use the [Bing Maps Account Center](https://www.bingmapsportal.com) to download a data source. For more information, see [Creating and Managing Data Sources](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh698204.aspx).  
  
 You can download a data source in three steps.  
  
-   [Create a Download Job](../../data-source-management-api/download-data-source-dataflow/create-a-download-job.md): Create a download job to download a published data source.  
  
-   [Get Download Data Source Job Status](../../data-source-management-api/download-data-source-dataflow/get-download-data-source-job-status.md): Monitor the job status to determine when the download is complete.  
  
-   [Get Downloaded Data](../../data-source-management-api/download-data-source-dataflow/get-downloaded-data.md): Use the URL provided in the download status response to access the entity data that was downloaded from the data source.
